<h1>Classes</h1>

Classes are a package of methods and variables that can be reused. It helps prevent really complcated variable names. You can assign proerties to the class like hair color, eye color and job. I will make an example class and use commits to explain it.
<br><br>

#declare class person
class person

#This code initializes the class when you create object person.
#During the initializes it takes name, age, job. Job as a default unemployed if you dont put a job in.
def initialize (name, age, job = 'unemployed')
  #This sets the instance variables. This is info that can be used in all the class.
  @name = name
  @age = age
  @job = job

end

#when you call this you can update the job.
def job_update(job_new)
  @job = job_new
end


end

#This allows you to initializes pat and bill as a person.
#Pat is a plumber who is 35.
Pat  = Person.new("Pat", 35, "plumber")
#Bill is a young unemployed person.
Bill = Person.new("Bill", 13)

Bill.job_update("paper_route")

Bill is now delivering papers.

<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
I was really lucky to had a good pair. We seamed both to be easy going so we just work together well.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
I do, It really helps see how things will work together.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
Use a tool to make it. KISS are the best. Keep it simple.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
none, Just got to work with them more. The more I work with the the better.
