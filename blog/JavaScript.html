<h1>The wrath of the semicolon</h1>


<br><br>
The more coding languages you learn the harder it gets to keep them straight. You get confused and start writing code in the wrong syntax. The one thing that stays the same is the logic. This is why pseudocoding helps so much. You can talk about a project no matter what the other party can code in.
<br><br>
Pseudocoding comes in handy. You can think of pseudocoding as the planning of a long car trip. If during your pseudocoding you find out that you need to take a 6th person to cover costs a 4 seat car won't work so you may have to use a van.
<br><br>
I was working very close with a DBA on a project. We use pseudocoding to talk about the work without having to get into syntax. If we had to worry about semicolons while talking we would never have gotten work done.
<br><br>
After pseudocoding you do need to convert it to real code. With knowing more than a few languages it can get confusing on the syntax. You may find yourself falling into the wrath of a semicolon. “This should be working!?!” The best thing to do is stand up and move around. When you come back you will notice that semicolon that you missed and you will be pissed. I don’t even want to think of the number of hours I have wasted on simple syntax issues.
<br><br>
After your break if you still can’t see the tree through the forest start off simple and work your way up. For example remind yourself of what language you are in and check for things like semicolon. With ruby not having many things like random semicolon it will take some getting used to but after a while you learn what needs them and what does not.
