<h1>Biography</h1>

I was born in germany on a army base. We bounced around a lot in my early years. Memories from that age are fuzzy. You know the feeling that you are never sure if you are recalling first hand accounts or an impartal memory from a photo you once saw. You know the forgotten albom your mom only brings out when you bring someone home for the first time.

After bouncing around for years I ended up in red bluff. I then moved to chico ca for all the wrong reasons. This is were I have set up roots.
<br><br>
I enjoy all the normal things. Movies, tv, games and cooking.

<br><br>
My educational experiences have ranged from bad to worse. I have gone to college a few times trying to get my degree done. I just never seam to have enough money to get it done. I for the most part am self tought IT and coding. The school of hard knocks is a lot harder then you would think.

<br><br>
Something quirky about me is that I can pick up things with my feet. I have a bad back so I use my feet to pick things up off the floor and hand... no foot them to my hands.

Thank you for reading about me.
