      What are the benefits of version control?
      The main benefits of version control are so you can track changes big and small. You can track a change from version 1.0 to 2.0 or you can track a simple spelling error change. By tracking the changes you can research bugs and also roll back the software if there is an issue with an update you have made.

      How does git help you keep track of changes?
      The biggest help is that git does a lot of the work for you. When you change a file, you can use git to compare the old and new versions. Git will take the changes and create a entry for github. By forcing people to submit through git, you will make sure you get at least what changed. Prior to version control, when people updated a file, they would have to make a note on what they changed...but most people would not do any documentation on changes, so researching bugs was much harder than today.

      Why use GitHub to store your code?
      GitHub will centralize your code so many devlopers can use it from many locations. By having your code centralized, you can make sure everyone has access to the latest code. This allows anyone from any location to do code reviews.
